| **Name**   | **Description** |
|------------|---|
| SQL Editor | Write the SQL Query statement in the editor. Based on the database selected in Basic Information, use the corresponding SQL statement. |
| Parameters | Click the + button on the far right of the parameters list to add the parameters. They act as placeholders for which you can pass concrete values when executing a query.  Each parameter contains three properties:  <br>- Name: The name of the parameter. After SQL Query, you only need to modify the value of the parameter to make the SQL statement execute according to different conditions. <br>- Data Type: The data type of the parameter. <br>- Test Value: This value is used as a parameter value during the result test to test the query.   Note: In SQL statements, the @ symbol is prefixed to the parameter, and the parameter can only be used in a where statement.   <br>**Note**: When the data type is DateTime, the test value will include a UTC option, which is only applicable to PostgreSQL databases. |

## Result

Once the SQL Query is written, it can be tested directly on the current page without binding it to a control.
