# Create Symbol

You can create symbols in the "Symbol" editor. Once created, a symbol can be used as a template and then instantiated multiple times across different screens. Each instance will have the same components and properties, but the data can vary. Any changes made to the template will automatically update across all symbol instances.

## Add Symbol

You can expand any symbol library, click the ➕ within the library, and a new window will pop up. Set the name of the symbol and click the "OK" button to create the symbol.

After creation, an empty symbol editor will be displayed in the main design space. The initial symbol editor is completely transparent. You can set a background if you want.

## Edit Symbol

Just like drawing a screen, you can add components (e.g., controls, images, symbols) in the symbol window. Once a symbol is modified, all instances of that symbol will be updated.

When your symbol creation is complete, you can open the symbol for editing using the following four methods:

1. Double-click the symbol in the "Symbol Library" to automatically open the symbol's editing window in the editor.
2. Right-click the symbol and select "Edit" from the context menu that appears.

2. In the editor, double-click the symbol component to open the symbol for editing.
3. In the editor, right-click the selected symbol component and choose the "Edit" button from the context menu to open the symbol.

## Move Symbol

You can change the symbol's associated symbol library by dragging and dropping. To move a symbol to another library, click on the symbol and drag the mouse to the target library, then release the mouse to drop it.

**Note:** If the symbol is currently open, you cannot perform the operation of moving the symbol. 

## Copy/Paste Symbol

Right-click on a symbol in the symbol library and select the "Copy" option to duplicate the symbol.

## Instance Symbol

Once the symbol is created, you can drag the symbol onto the screen or screen template to create multiple instances of the symbol. After the instances are created, you can manipulate their properties just like any other control.
