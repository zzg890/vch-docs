# Introduction to the Editor

All pages need to be drawn within an editor. VC Hub has a built-in WYSIWYG(What you see is what you get) editor. The WYSIWYG editor offers the benefits of real-time preview, intuitive operation, reduced errors, and improved consistency, making it easier for users to create and edit content with faster, more intuitive feedback.

The default window that displays when you first open a project has the following quick-start options. Create a new window by selecting the desired window type to be created. Opening it again displays the window that was open the last time you closed the browser, so you can continue editing from where you left off.

## **Toolbar**

There is a toolbar at the top of the editor. When the mouse is placed over any button in the toolbar, a message box will appear indicating the function of the button.
