**Note:** The referenced system pictures do not support editing and deletion. If you no longer want to use it, you can click the delete button of the library to delete the reference. Deleting a system library does not actually delete the library, but deletes the reference relationship, which can be referenced again later.

## Use Pictures

1. Upload pictures to the library.
2. Drag pictures from the library directly onto the page.

**Path**

When an image is added to a page, the path is displayed in the properties. **Path format:** LibraryName.ImageName

If the image is from the system library, a `$` symbol will appear at the beginning of the path. **Path format:** *$.LibraryName.ImageName*

Image paths support binding.

**Example: Display different images based on device operating status**

**Steps:**

1. Draw two buttons on the page,name them **"Run"** and **"Stop"**.
2. Set mouse pressed event for the buttons. 

For the **Run** button: When pressed, modify the tag `@Region:Motor1.RunningStatus` to `1`, indicating that the device is turned on.

For the **Stop** button: When pressed, modify the tag `@Region:Motor1.RunningStatus` to `0`, indicating that the device is stopped.

**Move Pictures**

You can modify the image's path. To move the image to another library, click and drag the image to the target library, thereby changing its library.

![library3](../../assets/images/library3.gif)

**Notes：**  
1. Moving images into the system library is not supported. 
2. Images in the system library can be dragged into user-created libraries. Dragging an image is equivalent to copying it to the target library, and the original image in the system library remains unaffected.

## Copy/Paste Pictures

Right-click on an image in the gallery and select the **Copy** option to duplicate the image. Both system library images and user-uploaded images support copying.

#### Export Project

When exporting a project, the system library will not be exported, but other libraries will. When importing the exported project into another project, if the exported project uses images from the system library, you need to reference the system library again after the project is imported, otherwise the used system library images will appear as broken images on the page.

#### Export Workspace

When exporting a workspace, all libraries will be exported together. When importing the exported workspace into other node, open the project page under the workspace, and the pictures used on the page can be displayed normally.
