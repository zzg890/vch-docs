# Create Data Source

Data connection is the first step before any data analysis. The built-in report designer of VC Hub seamlessly integrates with VC Hub's historical database as well as enterprise SQL databases such as MySQL, SQL Server, Oracle, etc. This chapter will provide detailed instructions on how to use VC Hub's historical tags as data sources for reports.

1. Double click the mouse on the report and open the design window.
2. In the design pop-up window, click the "Add" button in the upper right corner of the data source list.

**Note:**
1. The dataset contains only 3 fields:

2. When the data source is automatically created, two parameters are automatically created for each data source: start date and end date. The end date defaults to **today**; the start date is **(current date - 7 days)**.
