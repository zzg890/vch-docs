**Note:**  
- The exported report file will be automatically stored in the "Download" directory of your computer. 
- When exporting multiple reports, each report appears as a separate zip file. 

## Import

You can only right-click the root node of the report and click Import to complete the import operation.

**Note:** Because the report involves tag information, in order to ensure that the report can run normally after being imported into a new project or project, the tag data must also be imported, and the tag paths must be completely consistent.

**Example**

Import reports from workspace A to workspace B.

1. Export a report under the report node of workspace A: daily production capacity.
