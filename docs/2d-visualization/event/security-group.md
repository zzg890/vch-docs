Once a security group is set for an event, when the event is triggered by running the page, a login window will pop up, requiring the user to authenticate. Only users who belong to the role of the set security group have permission to perform this event.

**Note:** The security group  is only effective when authentication is performed using a Local-type Identity Provider.
