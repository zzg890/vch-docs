# Controls

 This section describes all the built-in controls. After selecting a control, you can change its properties in the “ Properties“  window to change the appearance and behavior of the control.

The **Polyline**, **Polygon**, and **Pipeline** controls must be drawn on the page by clicking the control in the toolbar and then dragging the mouse to create the shape. Other controls can be added to the page directly by dragging them with the mouse.

When moving controls on the page with the mouse, if the number of selected controls exceeds 400, the selection box will be automatically cleared after the move.

To apply animation effects such as rotation to these controls, configure animations for the controls. To make the controls respond to user interaction, configure actions for them.
