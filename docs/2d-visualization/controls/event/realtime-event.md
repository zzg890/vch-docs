You can click and drag a column's margins on the preview and run page to adjust its width. You can also sort columns in ascending or descending order by clicking the up or down arrow next to each column header.

You can also click the pause button to pause data refresh, and query and view the data in the paused state. After clicking the pause button, the resume and query buttons are displayed.
