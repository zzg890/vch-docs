## **Stroke**

Borders are also commonly used to set the shape of the control. This includes the border color, border type, and border thickness. The border color is set similarly to the fill. In the Appearance property of the control, click the color selector of the border to set the color.

Type primarily controls the style of the line drawn, for example, with a dotted line. The Thickness setting is in pixels. On thick lines, you can more easily observe their effect.

## **Shadow**

By applying shadow effects to components, you can enhance the sense of depth and layering in the user interface.

This makes the UI look less flat and improves its overall visual appeal and professionalism.
