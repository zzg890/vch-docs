You can set the outer shadow and inner shadow.   <br> **Outer**   <br>- **Enable**: Whether to enable the shadow effect  <br>- **Color**: Used to set the shadow color <br> - **X**: Controls how far the shadow is shifted horizontally.  <br>`X = 10` → shadow moves 10px to the right  <br>`X = -5` → shadow moves 5px to the left <br>- **Y**: Controls how far the shadow is shifted vertically.  <br>`Y = 8` → shadow moves 8px downward  <br>`Y = -3` → shadow moves 3px upward <br> - **Blur**: Controls how soft or sharp the edges of the shadow appear. Higher values make the shadow more blurry and spread out. <br> **Inner**  <br>- **Enable**: Whether to enable the shadow effect  <br>- **Color**: Used to set the shadow color <br>- **X**: Controls how far the shadow is shifted horizontally.  <br>`X = 10` → shadow moves 10px to the right  <br>`X = -5` → shadow moves 5px to the left <br>**- Y**: Controls how far the shadow is shifted vertically.  <br>`Y = 8` → shadow moves 8px downward  <br>`Y = -3` → shadow moves 3px upward <br>- **Blur**: Controls how soft or sharp the edges of the shadow appear.
