| **Name**     | **Description**   |
|--------------|---------|
| Name         | The name of this control. |
| X            | The distance from the left side of the control to the left side of the canvas, in pixels.  |
| Y            | The distance from the top of the control to the top of the canvas, in pixels.  |
| W            | The width of the control, in pixels.  |
| H            | The height of the control, in pixels.  |
| Time Range   | Query based on the specified time period.  <br>![alt text](13.png)  <br>- **Last**: Set the time range for data display.    <br>- **Custom**: Set the start time and end time to customize the time range for data display.   |
| Query Mode   | Query according to the selected query mode, which includes: Raw, Fixed Points, and Periodic.  <br>- **Raw**: Retrieves all raw historical data within the selected time range. When selecting Raw, the aggregation mode of the tag is disabled. <br>- **Fixed Points**: Requires setting the number of points. The selected time range is divided into corresponding time intervals based on the set number of points, and one data point is selected from each interval according to the specified aggregation mode. <br>- **Periodic**: Requires setting a period. The selected time range is divided into corresponding time intervals based on the set period, and one data point is selected from each interval according to the specified aggregation mode.  |

**Note:** The historical chart is developed based on Echarts 5.x version. There is a flaw in the graduation number in this version, and it does not take effect according to the set value, causing the historical chart to also have this problem. Please wait for Echarts to fix this defect.
