# Pie Chart

A pie chart is used to display the proportion of different categories or components within a whole. It is based on a circle, which is divided into several sectors, with each sector's angle corresponding to the proportion of the category or component it represents. Pie charts are particularly suitable for showing percentages and other data relationships relative to the total.

There are two styles: **Pie Chart** and **Ring Chart**.
