Resolution Adaptation allows web pages to work properly on different devices. Whether on desktop computers, tablets or mobile devices such as cell phones, users can easily access them.

**Scenario Example 1**: Accessing the same page on different devices.

1. Draw the page and turn on resolution adaption and select aspect ratio scaling.
