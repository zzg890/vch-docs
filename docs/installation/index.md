# Installation and Upgrade

## **Installation Environment**

VC Hub provides installation packages for both Windows and Linux environments. VC Hub does not support container deployment. Do not run it in a container.

If an old version is already installed in the installation environment, please uninstall it first. VC Hub does not support upgrade installation. You must uninstall the installed version before each new installation.

***Note:*** ***Please close all local anti-virus software before installation.*** ***Because some antivirus software may mistakenly identify the installation files as viruses.***

## **Ports**

The installation program defaults to using port 8066 for HTTP and port 10443 for HTTPS. Please ensure that port 8066 is available during installation. 

| **Port** | **Description**                       | **Configuration**                       |
|----------|---------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| 8066     | HTTP default port                     | **"Node">"Node Settings">"Web Server"** |
| 10443    | HTTPS default port                    | **"Node">"Node Settings">"Web Server"** |
| 8099     | Networking default port               | **"Node">"Networking">"Main"**          |

## **Version**

VC Hub uses a version structure: "Major Version. Minor Version. Revision Version". The project data version must match the version of the running program to operate.

## **Uninstallation**

The user data directory and the installation program directory are independent. Uninstalling will not delete user data. If necessary, you can manually delete the user data directory.

## **Upgrade**

Within the maintenance period, you can upgrade to the VC Hub installation package released during the maintenance period for free.

If the maintenance has expired and has not been renewed, you can upgrade to the revision version for free. As long as the "Major Version. Minor Version" matches the current authorized version, there are no restrictions on upgrading.

Direct upgrade installation is not currently supported. Before upgrading, please uninstall first. After uninstalling, install the new version.
