## **How to trigger an event**

Specific events can be triggered by the following events.

#### **Mouse Event**

Mouse events refer to triggering specific events when the user uses the mouse to operate the page or controls. Include:

- Pressed
- Released
- Entered
- Exited

## **Event type**

#### **Navigation**

Simply select a page from the page list. When the trigger condition for the event is met, the selected page will open. Different opening positions can be set for pages of different types.

Once a security group is set for an action, when the action is triggered by running the page, a login window will pop up, requiring the user to authenticate. Only users who belong to the role of the set security group have permission to perform this event.
