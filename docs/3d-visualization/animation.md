# Animation

By rationally applying animation effects, VC Hub can bring users a more efficient, intuitive and pleasant interface interaction experience.

In VC Hub, when the model has animation attributes, the "Animation" column will be displayed in the attribute bar on the right. Click the setting button to set the animation.

## **Animation type**

VC Hub's 3D models support the following animation types:

#### Blink

The blink effect is easy to attract attention and is often used to alarm when abnormal conditions occur.

**Example**

Create a sphere model that represents an alarm light that flashes when the value of Temperature is greater than 40.

| **Name**   | **Value**   |
|:------------|:--------------------------|
| Enable     | Enable      |
| Bool value | Expression: tag('Default:temperature) > 40;  <br> **Note:** This animation only takes effect when the value is a Boolean value.  |
| Executions | The number of times to flash when the value is true        |
| Duration   | The execution time of each flash, unit ms.          |

#### Translocation

Let the model perform dynamic effects of displacement through paths.

**Example**

The model is displaced according to the path on the conveyor belt.

#### **Rotation**

The model rotates as the value changes.
