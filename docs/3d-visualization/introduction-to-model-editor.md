# Introduction to Model Editor

Models uploaded to the model library can be modified in the model editor. The operations of the model editor and the scene editor are the same.

However, the modification of the model will only take effect in the current scene, while the model modified by the model editor will not It will take effect on all models referenced by the scene. It is worth noting that if the model is modified in the editor, the modification of the model configuration in the scene editor will take precedence over the configuration in the model editor.

In the model editor, you can right-click the model through the model library in the property bar on the right side of the scene editor. Click modify to enter the model editor.
