# Support and Assistance

 You can access various forms of help through the VC Hub Support Center. We recommend that you start with the user manual, the manual includes all aspects of VC Hub that you need to understand. Additionally, we offer an interactive Online Forum where you can receive assistance from WAGO officials or other helpful users at any time by posting on the forum. You can also quickly find solutions by browsing through the Common Questions. Of course, if you are a paying customer, you can submit any issues you encounter to us at any time through our Ticketing System.

**Feedback and Comments**

 We also welcome your feedback and comments on all aspects of VC Hub. We will carefully consider your valuable opinions and suggestions and strive to improve our work based on them.
