**Web-based Implementation**

 VC Hub is fully implemented based on web standards, so you can directly run and operate your VC Hub application using a web browser. For example, you can connect and configure PLC or historical storage directly through a web browser, and you can also use a web browser to configure your VC Hub application. Another benefit of being based on web standards is that it can make your configuration screen easier to create and more aesthetically pleasing than traditional desktops.
