   -  Use an Admin account to create a new role under Access Level.
   -  Open the desired project in the editor.
   -  In the editor's settings, assign design and delete permissions for the role.

#### Breaking Change 4: Bezier curve removed

- **Impact** : Pages using the b ezier curve.
- **Change** : From version 4.2 ， Bezier curve removed from the tools.
- **Solution** : Use lines and arcs to replicate similar visuals.

#### Breaking Change 5: Sector control removed

- **Impact** : Pages using the sector control.
- **Change** : From version 4.2 ， Sector control removed from the tools.
- **Solution** : Design the shape externally and upload it as an image.

#### Breaking Change 6: XY chart control removed

- **Impact** : Pages using XY charts.
- **Change** : From version 4.2 ， XY chart removed from the tools.
- **Solution** : Use a custom chart control to replicate XY chart behavior.

#### Breaking Change 7: Scatter chart control removed

- **Impact** : Pages using scatter charts.
- **Change** : From version 4.2 ， Scatter chart removed from the tools.
- **Solution** : Use a custom chart control to simulate scatter plots.

#### Breaking Change 8: Custom tabs no longer supported in real-time/historical event controls

- **Impact** : Real-time and historical event controls.
- **Change** : From version 4.2 ， Custom tabs will no longer be shown after upgrade.
- **Solution** : Use the control’s filter conditions to perform custom queries at runtime.

#### Breaking Change 9: OPC UA device changes

- **Impact** : OPC UA devices.
- **Change** : From version 4.2, added discovery services and advanced group settings, which may caused previously connected devices to no longer function properly.
- **Solution** : Delete and recreate devices and groups.

 Please refer to：**Management->Devices-> OPC UA**

#### Breaking Change 10: Alarm table refactored

- **Impact** : Alarm history data query.
- **Change** : From version 4.2，new structure for alarm history table. After upgrading the old version to version 4.2, the history alarm control cannot query the history alarm data before the upgrade.
- **Solution** : Use the database management tool to open the corresponding database and execute the following script according to the database type.

**Note:**
 In versions prior to 4.2, the alarm acknowledgment mode was not stored in the database. Therefore, after synchronizing alarm data using the following script, all alarm acknowledgment modes will beset to "Automatic" by default.
