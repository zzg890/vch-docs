# Get Access token

Before testing the Open API, we should first acquire the access token.

1. Log in VC Hub, navigate to the **Security->OIDC Server(Open API)** page, and create a new pair of client ID and client secret.  For details about the API credential management page, refer to chapter **"Secutity -> OIDC Server(Open API) Registrations"**.

4. Create a GET request for the URL `https://localhost:8043/.well-known/openid-configuration.` Send the request by clicking the **Send** button, and extract the **Token URL** from the response. Note that the Open API only supports HTTPS protocol. The default port of https is 8043 and it can be configured on node settings page.  For the node settings page,  refer to chapter **"Node Configuration"**.

The access token can be extracted from the HTTP response. Note that the request body format must be  **x-www-form-urlencoded.**
