The detailed explanation is as follows: <br> 1. **Server address and port number:** `http://localhost:4300` This means that the request will be sent to a server named "**localhost**" and accessed via port number "**4300**". When adding a new entry, the current server address and port will be automatically retrieved. <br>2. **Page path:** `/#/alarm/` This path is fixed and points to the alarm confirmation page. <br>3. **Specific path:** `{urlPath}` This is a placeholder representing the specific alarm parameter path. When receiving an actual message, this placeholder will be replaced with the real alarm parameters. |
