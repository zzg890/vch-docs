To insert a parameter into the email content, click in the content window to place the cursor, then click the parameter settings button. From the parameter list, select the desired parameter by clicking on it, and it will be automatically inserted at the cursor's position. ![alt text](19.png)  **Note:**  **urlPath (alarm address parameter)** is used to construct the URL for the alarm information, which consists of the server address, port number, and the specific page path. The detailed explanation is as follows:  <br>1. **Server address and port number:** `http://localhost:4300` This means that the request will be sent to a server named "**localhost**" and accessed via port number "**4300**". When adding a new entry, the current server address and port will be automatically retrieved. <br>2. **Page path:** `/#/alarm/` This path is fixed and points to the alarm confirmation page. <br>3. **Specific path:** `{urlPath}` This is a placeholder representing the specific alarm parameter path. When receiving an actual message, this placeholder will be replaced with the real alarm parameters. |

In this window, select the previously created WeCom service, then choose one of its groups or user accounts.
