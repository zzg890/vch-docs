# Alarm Group

Alarm groups are used to categorize alarms with similar characteristics or relevance. For example, all alarms from the same production line or equipment can be grouped together into an alarm group, making management and monitoring more convenient.

In **Realtime Alarm control**, users can filter or sort alarms based on these alarm groups. For instance, the interface can be set to display alarms from only a specific alarm group. This is particularly important in large systems, as it reduces information overload and enhances the efficiency of operators.
