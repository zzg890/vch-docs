# History Storage

VC Hub allows you to store alarm data in a database. Basic data about the alarms that have occurred, such as path, time, level, status, etc. can be stored.

Multiple history database can be created, where you can store a part of the alarms in one database and another part of the alarms in another database. And set different storage policies for each library.

On the Historical Alarm control, you can select a history bank for data filtering.

## **Create a history database**
