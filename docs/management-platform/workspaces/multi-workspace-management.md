## **Function Description**

#### **Search**

After entering the workspace management page, the user can view all the workspaces in the current VC Hub system, which are listed in reverse chronological order by default, and can be customized according to the user's needs. Currently, it only supports the reverse chronological order of the **creation time** and name.

Select a local *.wsbk* file. If a password was set during export, you must enter the correct password to proceed with the import. Workspaces without a password can be imported directly.

Users can choose whether to retain the current system’s **node settings, redundancy **and **networking **information during import.

- If **Keep** is selected, the current node settings, redundancy and networking settings will remain unchanged after the import.
- If **Replace** is selected, the workspace data will be successfully imported. The node settings, redundancy, and networking information from the import file will overwrite the corresponding configuration of the current node. After the import is completed, the system will automatically restart, and the login page will be displayed after the restart.

If the name of the imported workspace is the same as an existing workspace in the list, the system will automatically append **_Copy** to the imported workspace’s name.

For a newly imported workspace, a **“** **New** **”** icon will be displayed after the workspace name for 30 minutes following the import.
