# Databases

 In VC Hub, the historical data, historical alarms and historical events of tags are eventually stored in a database. By connecting to the database, the stored data can be effectively managed in terms of data management. Using the powerful query and analysis functions of the database, the stored data can be statistically, analytically, and minutely mined, providing the user with more comprehensive and powerful data processing and application development capabilities.
