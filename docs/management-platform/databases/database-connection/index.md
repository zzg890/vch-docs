| Maximum Query Points   | When selecting MySQL, SQL Server, PostgreSQL, or SQLite, this field is displayed. It is used to define the maximum number of data points that can be retrieved in a single query execution for a specific database.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Query Timeout(s)       | When selecting MySQL, SQL Server, PostgreSQL, or SQLite, this field is displayed. It is used to define the maximum duration for executing a data query on a specific database. If the query is not completed within the specified time, the system will automatically terminate it. This setting helps prevent performance bottlenecks or system slowdowns caused by prolonged query operations.                                                                       |
