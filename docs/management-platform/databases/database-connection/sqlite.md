3. Enter the following information in the configuration interface (Note: The following data is only an example, please fill in according to the actual situation).

    Since SQLite is an open source embedded relational database that implements a self-contained, serverless, configuration-less, transactional SQL database engine. It is a zero-configuration database.

    So creating a SQLite database connection means creating a SQLite file locally. So there is no need for Host, Port, Username, Password, etc. You just need to check where the SQLite file is stored.
