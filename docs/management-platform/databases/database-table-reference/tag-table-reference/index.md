# Tag Table Reference
When a tag is enabled for historical recording, the VC Hub system automatically creates the corresponding table based on the historical repository configuration assigned to the asset that the tag belongs to. This ensures that historical data is stored in the appropriate structure, aligned with the asset's configuration.
