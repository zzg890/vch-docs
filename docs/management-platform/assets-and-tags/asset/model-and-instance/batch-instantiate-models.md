When the number of instances or custom attributes is large, performing operations directly on the page may be inconvenient. Therefore, we also provide an export and import function. You can export the data, edit it in Excel, and then import it back.

## Modify instance attributes through the exported file

#### Export 

After generating instances, click the **Export** button to export the instances.
