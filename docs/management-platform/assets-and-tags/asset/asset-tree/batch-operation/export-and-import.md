**Notes:**

1. After clicking the More button, the user can choose to import a JSON file that was previously exported. The imported file must match the current tab (Model or Instance); otherwise, an error message will be displayed.<br>

2. When importing instance data separately, ensure that the corresponding model objects exist in the current tree; otherwise, the import will fail.
