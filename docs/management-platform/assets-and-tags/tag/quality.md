# Quality

Quality is used as an property of a tag to indicate the level of confidence in the value of the tag. The quality of the tag is reflected by the quality level code.

The quality bit code consists of a level ("Good", "Uncertain", "Bad", "Error ") and an integer. If a value is bad quality, it should usually not be trusted .

You can view the quality of a tag in the Asset window by locating the tag you wish to view and expanding it. The following image shows a tag whose quality bit is Good, which means that the tag's current value is trusted.

## **Quality Codes**

There are currently four levels of quality codes set up in the system, Good, Bad, Uncertain and Error, and each level contains a series of sub-codes that will provide more specific quality information about the current tag.

The system divides the quality bits of each level into different code areas as follows:

1. **Good: 100~199**. Good quality, usually considered reliable and trustworthy.
2. **Uncertain: 200~299**. Uncertain quality, usually represents a good value, but the reliability cannot be determined because the new value has not been received. 
3.  **Bad: 300~399**. Bad quality, the value is problematic, but it is the "expected" or recognized type of problem. For example, the trial has expired or read access has been explicitly denied. 
4.  **Error: 400~499**. Error quality, completely unexpected problems. For example, a tag is misconfigured, a type is incorrect, and so on.

| Note: It is important to note that not every value in the range has a code, and the free values are used for future extensions and adding new codes. |

If a tag is bound to a control, the quality code of the bound value can be rendered by a corner marker. Corner markers are displayed only when the quality is Bad, Uncertain, and Error.
