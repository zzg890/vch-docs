## How to Log into the System When an OpenID Connect Identity Provider Becomes Invalid

If an incorrect configuration of the OpenID Connect Identity Provider prevents login, follow these steps:

1. Open a web browser and enter the login page URL for VC Hub, for example:http://localhost:8066/#/login, go to the login page of VC Hub.

      **localhost:8066** refers to the server address and port where **VC Hub** is deployed.

2. Log in using a user account created within **VC Hub**.
3. Modify the **Identity Provider** configuration as needed.
