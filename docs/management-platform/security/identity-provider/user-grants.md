# User Grants

User Grants is a method of directly assigning users to access levels. It essentially overrides the original rules of security levels.

You can authorize users through the **Security-> Identity Provider** list by clicking the **User Grants** button. Users can be added, allowing you to later assign them specific access levels.

**Note:** Adding or removing users in User Grants does not affect the users within the **Identity Provider**.

You can assign any number of access levels to these users by their **username**. Selecting a level will automatically select all levels above it.

User Grants can only be applied to users after they authenticate through the Identity Provider.

**Note:** The system cannot verify any users created here based on the actual users in the Identity Provider. Instead, the **username** needs to be entered **accurately**, including case sensitivity. When users log in, the system will check if their username matches any of the configured usernames to grant user authorization.

## Configuring User Grants

Configuring user grants is divided into two parts: adding users, assigning access levels to users.

1. Click the **"Security" → "Identity Provider"** menu.

5. After setting the access levels for one user, continue selecting the next user to configure their access levels. Once all users have been configured, click the **"OK"** button to save the settings.
