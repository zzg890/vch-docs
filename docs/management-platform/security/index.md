# Security

The purpose of security is to control access and operational rights to the system, applications, or resources.  By setting security , it is possible to ensure that only authorized users or roles are able to perform specific operations, thus increasing system security and data protection.

 VC Hub implements privilege management by setting up access levels .

 The following are a few important effects of setting permissions:

1.  Access Control: Privilege settings can restrict the access rights of users or roles to the system or application. For example, only specific users or roles are allowed to view, edit or delete certain sensitive data or functions.
2.  Data Protection: Permission settings allow you to control read, write, and modify access to data. Only users or roles with appropriate permissions can access ormodify protected data, thus ensuring data integrity and confidentiality.
3.  System Security: Permission settings prevent unauthorized users or roles from performing malicious operations or accessing sensitive system functions. Only authorized users or roles can perform specific system-level operations,protecting the system from potential security threats.
4.  Role Management: With permission settings, you can define different user roles and assign specific permissions to each role. This simplifies the permission management process and improves the scalability and flexibility of the system.

 In summary, setting security  helps organizations and managers to ensure the security of VC Hub systems and data, as well as to ensure that users or roles can only perform the actions they need to perform, thus achieving a reasonable access control and protection mechanism .
