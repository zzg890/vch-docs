## **How do I get data from my PLC?**

 The process of getting data from a PLC into VC Hub is divided into two steps:

1.  Add the device.
2.  Add the I/O tag in the Assets window of the editor. Bind a data source to the tag and select the device you added in step 1 in the data source. See the "Creating Tags" page.
3.  Bind a data source to the tag and select the device you added in step 1 in the data source. See the "I/O Tag Binding Data Source" page.
