# SIEMENS S7

The Siemens driver in VC Hub supports the basic connection to S7 devices. Currently, VC Hub has drivers for the following Siemens PLCs:

- S7-300
- S7-400
- S7-1200
- S7-1500
## **Connecting to SIEMENS Devices**

1. On the "**Devices**" -> "**SIEMENS S7**" screen, click the "Add" button.
2. On the Add page, leave all the default values and enter the following information in the following fields (Note: The following data is only an example, please fill in according to the actual situation).

   Device Name: Siemens 1200

   Model: S7-1200

   Host: Enter the IP or domain name of the device, e.g. 100.10.4.12

   Port: 102

   Rack: 0

   Slot: 2

   Frequency: 1000

3. Click on the **"OK"** button. The data will now be displayed in the device list page of the SIEMENS S7. The status column only indicates the start/stop status of the driver, it does not represent the real connection status with the device.

|--------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Device Name        | The name of the device connection.                                         |
| Model              | The model number of the device. Includes S7-300, S7-400, S7-1200, S7-1500. |
| Host               | The domain name or IP address of the device.                               |
| Port               | The port to use when connecting to the device.                             |
| Rack               | The rack number where the device is located.                               |
| Slot               | The slot number assigned to the CPU.                                       |
| Frequency          | The frequency of data acquisition in milliseconds.                         |
| Connection Timeout | Connection timeout in milliseconds.                                        |
| Read Data Timeout  | Timeout for reading data, in milliseconds.                                 |
| Write Data Timeout | Timeout for writing data, in milliseconds.                                 |

**Note:**

1. In the device list, The **Enabled Status** indicates whether the device has been enabled or not, unenabled devices will not connect and enabled devices will try to connect; the **Connection Status** indicates whether the device has successfully established a communication connection with the system.
2. **Enable All** and **Disable All** are to enable or disable all data in the list.
3. Shared connection of multiple devices under the same IP is not supported for the time being.
4. Per-bit writes are not supported for Bool tags; each write value overwrites the previous byte.
5. For S7-1200 and S7-1500, the following precautions and configuration changes must be made:

- Optimized block access must be turned off.
