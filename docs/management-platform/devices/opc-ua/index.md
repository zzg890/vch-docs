![alt text](3.png)

   **Note**: Click the "**Skip**" button to manually configure connection settings. This is especially useful when the server does not allow anonymous endpoint access but provides a separate discovery endpoint. 


3. Select a server and click "Next" to proceed to the "Select Endpoint" page. Choose a security policy and security mode. The default selection is **Best Available**. Selecting an entry means that the chosen security policy and security mode will be used to connect to the endpoint.

9. Click the **"OK"** button. The data will be displayed under the previously created device.

![alt text](11.png)

## **Note**

1. **Enable All** and **Disable All **are to enable or disable all data in the list.
2. The **MaxNodesPerBrowse** configuration item on the server side affects the loading performance of the driver node, and it is recommended to set this configuration item to a larger value when more measurement points are configured on the server side.
3. In the device list, The **Enabled Status** indicates whether the device has been enabled or not, unenabled devices will not connect and enabled devices will try to connect; the **Connection Status** indicates whether the device has successfully established a communication connection with the system.
## **Connection Example**

#### **Connecting with Kepware**

Configure the OPC client connection:

1. Follow the steps in the example above to create an OPC UA device and group. 
2. Click Test Connection.

![alt text](12.png)

3. The connection will be displayed as "**Test Connection Failed**". This is usually correct and expected because KEPServerEX denies access to the OPC UA client that the system creates for the first time. Therefore it is only necessary to allow KEPServerEX to trust the OPC UA client created by the system. 
4. On the server where KEPServer is installed, right-click on the KEPServerEX icon on the desktop where KEPServerEX is installed and select "**OPC UA Configuration**" from the menu. As shown in the following figure, click the Trusted Clients tab:

![alt text](13.png)


5. Click the Trusted Clients tab.

![alt text](14.png)

6. Click the corresponding OPC UA client for your system, click the** Trust **button, and then click Close. The OPC Server Connections page now displays the status of the Kepware to which you want to connect.
7. Right-click the KEPServerEX icon on the desktop where KEPServerEX is installed and select **Reinitialize** from the menu.
8. Re-click **Test Connection** to verify that the connection was successful.
9. Click **View** in the action bar to display information about the directories or nodes configured in the OPC UA server (Kepware).

![alt text](15.png)


10. Click on any directory or node to display the relevant property information for the current directory or node on the right side.

![alt text](16.png)


#### **Connecting with Codesys**

Check OPC Port in Codesys:

![alt text](17.png)




Configure the OPC client connection:

1. Follow the steps in the example above to create an OPC UA device and group. 
2. Click Test Connection.

![alt text](18.png)

3. Trust WagoScada certificate in Codesys

![alt text](19.png)

## **Binding to Tags**

Bind tags to data in the driver.

1. Create an I/O tag.

![alt text](20.png)

2. On the add window, click the binding button of the data source.

![alt text](21.png)


3. In the pop-up data source window, you will see the node tree of the OPC UA Server. This tree structure reflects the server's hierarchy, containing all available objects, directories, and nodes.
   1. Click the expand button ▶ next to a node name to expand the node and view its child nodes.
   2. Click on the node you wish to bind. Once selected, the node will be highlighted, and the right window will update to display the relevant property information for that node.
   3. If the selected node is an array, you can enter the desired index in the designated field on the right to access specific elements of the array. For example, entering 0 will access the first element of the array.
   ![alt text](22.png)
4. After completing the node selection and property editing, please ensure that you click the '**OK**' button on the interface to save your settings and binding information.
5. If you decide not to proceed with the current binding, you can click the **'Cancel'** button to discard the changes you've made.

**Important Note on Updating NodeId:**

If you manually or batch-update the **NodeId** property, you must also update the corresponding **Path** property accordingly — or re-select the node in the Data Source Binding window. Failure to do so may cause the node displayed in the UI to become inconsistent with the actual bound node.
