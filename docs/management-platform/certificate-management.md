# Certificate Management

Used to centrally manage certificates. Each type of certificate is stored independently. Includes:

- **Web Server Certificate:** Used to configure secure communication between Web clients (such as browsers) and the VC Hub server.
- **Redundancy / Networking Certificate:** Used to configure secure communication between multiple VC Hub nodes in redundancy or networking mode.
- **MQTT Broker Certificate:** Used to configure secure communication between MQTT clients (such as field devices or VC Hub clients) and the MQTT Broker.

- If the user does not have a TLS certificate, they can select the **System self-signed certificate** option to use the built-in system certificate for secure communication.Clicking the **Regenerate** button will generate a new self-signed certificate.
