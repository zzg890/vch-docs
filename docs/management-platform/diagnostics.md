## **Dashboard**

The dashbaord is used to monitor and display the key indicators and data in real time to help users better understand the system operation and find and solve possible problems in time.

Indicators to be monitored:

- CPU Average Utilization
- Memory Utilization
- Memory Utilization

#### **CPU Average Utilization**

View the current CPU average utilization status through numerical values and line graphs. When the CPU average utilization exceeds 100%, it does not mean that the CPU is overloaded, but it is related to the number of cores of the CPU, for example, if the server CPU has 8 cores, then the percentage base of CPU utilization is 800%.
